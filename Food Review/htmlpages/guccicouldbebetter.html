    <h1>Gucci could be better</h1>
    <p>Honestly who wouldn't want to have some expensive clothing every now and then. 
    Its almost flexing to others is fueling another ego in people now. Why should you want 
    nor care what other think because its bringing horror to my eyes. Like for example refere to this images on 
    this page. Honestly they could do way better with the moeny they are blowing at this point. 
    Take me for a hater and I'll tell you I defently am when it comes to dumb things like this. Don't get wrong
    they have some good clothes but, most of the time they be thinking they could make anything fashion like no 
    get real. They aren't the only ones to levae us people victim to such atrosity. </p>
