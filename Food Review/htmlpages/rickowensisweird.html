    <h1>Just Rick Owens</h1>
    <p>
    Im going to start this off with this might be the longest one out of the rest this is not because I love
    hating but I just dont understand this man. Based off these images alone Im just thinking that he just loves himself
    honestly. Just look at his models and what he makes them wear. I don't know if this man is making moeny from this 
    Im just more curious as to how there is a flowing around this. I may understand owning your own brand and being 
    able to make anything for someone out their to love what you make. I find it hard to find it here. Once I make it big 
    or make myself a million I would truly understand what taste is because apparently I just dont have any. Rick Owen does
    and I can say this may be a good thing as he stand out from the other brands.

    The props I give to people is little but it makes a difference as it points out some gems in the toilet
        Its just weird to me that anyone with that kind of money start to make his own clothing, or maybe thats the point
        of his brand to only be used by him that is just out in public. I would believe that story then trying to make this 
        the new wave. Me personally I could go to JCpenny and pull something better then his whole brand and this comes
        from someone who used to get dressed by their mom. Have fun <a href="../mainpages/index.html">here.</a>
